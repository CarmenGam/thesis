TEST DAC Procedure: Measurement of the maximum and minimum voltage of the DAc's (it is possible to know the range of the 6 DAC's) directly from the output pin
of the ASIC by a Multimeter. Each DAC is composed by a 2 DAC's of 9 bits (Positive part P and negative part N) to get a final resolution of 10 bits. To measure
this it is set the code in the register with the maximum values of the Positive part (P), the minimum value of P and the same with Negative part (N).

(Values in Volts)
High Limit Comparation Maximum P: 2,177 and 1,888	Low Limit Comparation Minimum P: 1,474 and 1,321

TEST Voltage Procedure: Measurement of the gain of all seven input single channels and the two outputs for 10 different voltages (from 100mV to 1000mV)
using a rate scan methodology, consisting on the comparison of the input trigger rate from a generator on the evaluation setup and the ASIC trigger output rate.
This computation is performed with scalers implemented in the FPGA board.

ANALOG OFFSET TEST Procedure: Measurement of the offset in the Analog Adder Output test, which is the output of a multiplexor that selects among the
available analog output adder, plus a buffer for the output pins. The measurement is directly from the differential output pin of the ASIC by a Multimeter.

DIGITAL OFFSET TEST Procedure: Measurement of the offset in the LVDS digital outputs, 0 and 1, by the evaluation of the outputs status as a funtion of the threshold.
The methodology consist on increasing the threshold from 0 Volts using the DAC's values until find the minimum value that the output crosses from 1 to 0, and the
maximum cross from 0 to 1. The voltage between this two points is the noise of the digital output, and the mean point is the offset. Setting the Threshold to 0 it
is possible 3 different behaviors: If the status of the digital output is always a logic "1" (tagged as type "Pos") it is possible to measure the minimum and the maximum points and therefore 
it is possible to calculate the Offset and the noise.
If the status of the digital ouput is always a logic '0' (tagged as type "Neg"), it is not possible to measure neither the minimum nor the maximum point, and then a value of zero is
assigned by the program both to the noise and the offset.
Finally, if the status of the digital ouput is switching (tagged as type "Com"), it is only possible to measure the maximum value, and the other is assigned to 0. In this case the noise is
understimated and the threshold is overstimated

(Maximum and minimum values are in Volts [V]. The Noise and the Offset are in miliVolts [mV])
