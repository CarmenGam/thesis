abstract="A review is given of the main properties of the charged component of galactic cosmic rays, particles detected at Earth with an energy spanning from tens of MeV up to about 1019 eV. After a short introduction to the topic and a historical overview, the properties of cosmic rays are discussed with respect to different energy ranges. The origin and the propagation of nuclei in the Galaxy are dealt with from a theoretical point of view. The mechanisms leading to the acceleration of nuclei by supernova remnants and to their subsequent diffusion through the inhomogeneities of the galactic magnetic field are discussed, and some clue is given on the predictions and observations of fluxes of antimatter, both from astrophysical sources and from dark matter annihilation in the galactic halo.The experimental techniques and instrumentations employed for the detection of cosmic rays at Earth are described. Direct methods are viable up to â‰ƒ 1014 eV, by means of experiments flown on balloons or satellites, while above that energy, due to their very low flux, cosmic rays can be studied only indirectly by exploiting the particle cascades they produce in the atmosphere.The possible physical interpretation of the peculiar features observed in the energy spectrum of galactic cosmic rays, and in particular the so-called ``knee'' at about 4 {\texttimes}1015 eV, is discussed. A section is devoted to the region between about 1018 and 1019 eV, which is believed to host the transition between galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays. The conclusion gives some perspectives on the cosmic ray astrophysics field. Thanks to a wealth of different experiments, this research area is living a very flourishing era. The activity is exciting both from the theoretical and the instrumental sides, and its interconnection with astronomy, astrophysics, and particle physics experiences nonstop growth.",
