\section{Introduction}

The \gls{lmc} is one of the closest satellite galaxies of the \gls{mw}, at a distance of $\sim$ 50 kpc \cite{2013LMCdistance1}. Thanks to its proximity, large volume and orientation angle ($\sim$ 30ยบ \cite{2004StructureandOrientationLMC}), it is observed as an extended object of about 10ยบ diameter in the sky, which has allowed the study of its structure and individual components in great detail. Observations of the \gls{lmc} in the whole electromagnetic spectrum have revealed the presence of a big number of extreme objects such as pulsars \cite{2013RadioPulsarsLMC} \cite{2016LMCFermiLAT}, \glspl{snr} \cite{2015MultiwavelengthLMCsnr} \cite{2012XMM1987} \cite{2016SNRinXrayLMC},  \gls{pwne} \cite{2015HESSTeVLMC} \cite{2016LMCFermiLAT} \cite{2003PWNeintheLMC} \cite{2008PWNeXrayLMC} and gamma-ray binaries \cite{2017HESSLMCP3}. Many of these objects are known to be cosmic-ray accelerators and therefore potential $\gamma$-ray emitters. $\gamma$-ray emission up to TeV energies from several sources within the \gls{lmc} has already been detected by the current generation gamma-ray experiments \textit{Fermi}-LAT and H.E.S.S. and it is expected that many more objects will be discovered by the future \gls{cta}.\\
The remarkable interest of the \gls{lmc} for $\gamma$-ray astrophysics relies on its high star formation activity, which implies a high supernova rate and thus a large population of $\gamma$-ray sources. Also, it offers a unique opportunity to study the relation between star formation and cosmic-ray production and propagation, as an alternative to the \gls{mw}.\\
\glspl{cr} are an important component of \gls{ism} in galaxies, with energy densities comparable to that of magnetic fields. The origin and propagation of \glspl{cr} is still a field of study as well as their role in galaxy evolution. It is very likely that they have a significant effect in star formation, acting as an extrinsic feedback source. The basic idea is that, even the energy injection rate of \glspl{cr} is negligible compared to other by-products of star formation, such as photons, winds and supernova shocks, they interact with the \gls{ism} and exchange a significant amount of momentum. Studies on starburst galaxies luminosities \cite{2008SocratesCRandSF} have established that it is possible that cosmic-ray winds are produced in high star formation rate regions, perturbing the hydrostatic balance and truncating star formation. On the other hand, infrarred observations of \gls{ulrigs} suggest that \glspl{cr} are able to heat gas in molecular clouds and are their main agent of temperature regulation and ionization, fundamentally altering the initial conditions for star formation \cite{2010PapadopoulosCRinSF}.\\
While \gls{lmc} evolution is closely related to the \gls{mw} and the rest of the local group, the observations of very young globular clusters in the \gls{lmc} suggests that its \gls{sfh} is fundamentally different to that of the \gls{mw}. In fact, the \gls{lmc} is currently in a star formation epoch with a rate of $\sim$ 0.2 $M_{\odot}$ which was reignited 4-5 Gyrs ago after a dramatic event affecting the \gls{ms} (composed by the \gls{lmc} and the \gls{smc}) \cite{2009SFHofLMC}. The \gls{lmc} is classified as an irregular galaxy, the most common type in the universe. In general, irregular galaxies are simpler, less dusty and with lower metallicity than spiral galaxies (like the \gls{mw}). Because they are less evolved, they present higher gas content and lower abundance of heavy elements \cite{2013InfrarredLMC}. All these differences with respect to the \gls{mw} affecting the characteristics of the \gls{ism}, are fundamental for the study of the production and propagation of \glspl{cr} in star forming regions, and allow to use the \gls{lmc} as an alternative probe to the \gls{mw}.
Characterizing the \glspl{cr} origin and propagation throughout the \gls{ism} is not an easy task, as charged particles are deflected by magnetic fields, making it impossible to reconstruct their trajectories and thus, pointing back to their origin form Earth. The best way to study cosmic-ray physics in the galaxies is through the diffuse emission from radio to $\gamma$-rays that they produce when interacting with other particles in the \gls{ism} and the radiation of magnetic fields. The leptonic component of this emission, produced by cosmic-ray electrons, can be probed by radio, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray observations. The radio diffuse emission come from synchrotron emission of cosmic-ray electrons injected by supernova remnants. They can also suffer \gls{ic} scattering with photons of the interstellar radiation field or the cosmic microwave background, producing emission from X-ray to $\gamma$-rays \cite{2008ICgammaray}. The hadronic component of diffuse cosmic-ray emission is produced (mainly) by cosmic-ray proton inelastic collisions with the \gls{ism} particles, which produce pions resulting in a continuum $\gamma$-ray emission coming from pion decay \cite{1963Pimesonsproducegammarays}. As hadrons make up the 90\% of the \glspl{cr} composition, $\gamma$-rays are a fundamental probe for cosmic-ray production and propagation. 
A galaxy like the \gls{lmc}, externally viewed and nearly face on offers an unique opportunity for studying the diffuse distribution of \glspl{cr} in a galaxy, in comparison with the \gls{mw} which has the problem of line-of-sight confusion of sources. \textit{Fermi}-LAT observations of the \gls{lmc} revealed a diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission little correlated with the large scale distribution of the gas column density of the galaxy \cite{2010FermiLATLMC11months}. This correlation would be observed if cosmic-rays could freely diffuse in the \gls{ism} as it is observed in the \gls{mw}. Instead, it appears to be much more correlated with tracers of massive star forming regions such as the 30 Doradus region \cite{2012CRinLMC30Doradus}.\\
Beyond the extraordinary opportunities for cosmic-ray physics, the \gls{lmc} offers also the possibility to help solving the fundamental problem of \gls{dm}. The \gls{lmc} has a mass of the order of $10^9$ M$_{\odot}$ enclosed in 8.9 kpc and more than a half is due to a dark halo \cite{2002LMCkinematics}. Study of the rotational curves of the \gls{lmc} revealed that also it must contain a dark compact bulge with an anomalously high mass-to-luminosity ratio as large as $\sim 20-50$ \cite{1999LMCbulge} compared of that of the calculated for the \gls{mw} $\sim$ 7 M/L \cite{2013MWbulge}. With these characteristics, \gls{lmc} would be the most \gls{dm} massive object after the \gls{gc} offering an alternative source for indirect searches of \gls{dm} signal.\\
Among all the theories trying to explain the nature of \gls{dm}, the \gls{wimp} theory is one of the most popular, explaining \gls{dm} as a particle which can suffer annihilation or decay into \gls{dm} particles. Different channels of annihilation would produce a certain spectrum of gamma-rays \cite{2011cirelli} which could be detected as an excess over the $\gamma$-ray flux produced by baryonic backgrounds. Following this scheme, \textit{Fermi}-LAT used five years of data to search for a \gls{dm} annihilation signal in $\gamma$-rays and placed competitive bounds on the annihilation cross section as a function of the dark matter particle mass and annihilation channel \cite{2010FermiLATLMC11months}.\\
The \gls{lmc} Survey is one of the \gls{ksp} of \gls{cta} \cite{2019SciencewithCTA}, with more than 300h of dedicated observations and many scientific objectives: population studies of \glspl{snr} and \gls{pwne}, transport of \glspl{cr} and searches of \gls{dm}.
In this chapter, which is the core of this thesis, a characterization of the \gls{lmc} in the energy range of \gls{cta} is performed, in order to cast predictions on the possible results of the \gls{lmc} survey. Our methodology is to build an emission model of the \gls{lmc} and use a dedicated \gls{cta} software to perform simulations of the survey data products. We use a maximum likelihood approach to calculate the detection significance of the different sources of $\gamma$-rays in the \gls{lmc}, as well as the possibilities for setting a realistic model of the diffuse cosmic-ray emission. In the same way, we calculate sensitivity curves for the detection of a possible \gls{dm} annihilation signal. The structure of the paper is as follows:
In section \ref{sec:model} we describe the emission model we use for the \gls{lmc}. Section \ref{sec:simana} is dedicated to details on simulation and analysis methods for \gls{cta} observations. In section \ref{sec:res} results on significance for detection of diffuse emission and point sources in the LMC are presented. In section \ref{sec:dminlmc} we describe the models of a possible \gls{dm} emission from the \gls{lmc} and we calculate sensitivity curves for \gls{cta} detection of such signal. In section \ref{sec:systematics} possible systematics mainly related to the instruments are discussed. Finally, section \ref{sec:conclusions} is dedicated to conclusions.
